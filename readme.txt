JucePy
Project executed as Harvard CS50x Introduction to Computer Science final project.

A State of CearÃ¡, Brazil, Trade Board process tracker database.
JucePy automatically updates a database with a process history - you can keep track of everything without manually going
to JUCEC website every hour :-)

JucePy runs as a server and keeps the processes info at a database, so multiple user can interact with it simultaneously


USAGE:

After installing the required modules and prerequisites as below, **and setting FLASK_APP environment variable***,
just execute on command line (bash, CMD, Powershell) the command:

"flask run --port=8080" (to keep access for only your machine) or:
"flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080" (to give access to your network)

Then it can be accessed at your browser with by SERVERIP:8080

For windows, the file "RUN.bat" automatically runs set the flask env and run the server (exposed to network), given that
required modules, etc, are correctly installed.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Install Python - https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. To install module requirements go to the install folder and  run the command: "pip install -r requirements.txt"

3. Before running the script, remember to change FLASK_APP environment variable:
